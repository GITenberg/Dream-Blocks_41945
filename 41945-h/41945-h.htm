I think some day that I may see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little brownie elf</span><br />
Peep out of there, and speak to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I am by myself.</span><br />
<br />
I like my roses at the side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much better than the flower-row</span><br />
Along your path where people ride.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I leave my roses just to grow.</span><br />
<br />
I like the place that's broken, too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With splintered edges all around,</span><br />
And grasses growing right up through,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That smell so fresh like dew and ground.</span><br />
<br />
Your steps are nice, but then my own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seem nicer somehow, just for me;</span><br />
Pine steps are more like home than stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For once they lived and were a tree.</span><br /><br /><br />

Our Big Clock goes! It's very rude<br />

When I must always go to bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hands just fly in wicked glee.</span><br />
It strikes out long ahead<br />

The worn-out, patched-up blue<br />

It clings to me as if it loved<br />

Correctly, with its top so queer,<br />
In front of my big window here.<br />
<br />
It is not like my Country Tree,<br />
Good friend of every bird and bee,<br />
Who keep it merry company<br />
And always sing and talk to me.<br />
My Country Tree laughs all day long.<br />
Its fresh leaves whisper in a song<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Their secrets just for me to hear.<br />
Its branches lean so very near<br />
The ground, that grasses stretch and try<br />
To meet the boughs not swung too high.<br />
There is the place, the very best<br />
In all the world, to play and rest.<br />
<br />
The City Tree stands all alone<br />
Above the clean-swept pavement stone.<br />
No little children ever stay<br />
Beneath its trimmed-off shade to play&mdash;<br />
They aren't brave enough to dare,<br />
Because it is so proper there.<br />
There are no lady-birds about;<br />
No crickets frolic in and out.<br />
The City Tree is very proud,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>It hasn't even looked or bowed.<br />
We're not at all acquainted yet&mdash;<br />

I'll see my country tree again?<br />

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
